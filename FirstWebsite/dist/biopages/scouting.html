					<p>
						Scouting has and is still changing since I was a member of the BSA, but regardless of the minor changes it makes it will
						always hold a special place in my heart because I grew up in it and am an Eagle Scout. For anyone that doesn't know what
						scouting is, I will elaborate on it and why it was and still is important for me as an individual, but understand that
						achieving the rank of Eagle isn't an
						<span style="font-style: italic"> easy </span> task.

					<h2 class="text-secondary" style="text-align:center">What is Scouting</h2>
					<p>
						Scouting or the Scout Movement is a movement with a strong focus on the outdoors and survival skills that aims to support
						young people in their physical, mental, and spiritual development so that they may play constructive roles in society.

					<h2 class="text-secondary" style="text-align:center">Why it is important to me</h2>
					<p>
						I was in the scouting program for eleven years. I've made countless memories and freinds that otherwise would have never been
						possible; it's brought me across and out of the country; and scouting has taught me leadership skills that I otherwise
						wouldn't have obtained.
