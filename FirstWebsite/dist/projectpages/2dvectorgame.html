						This was meant to be our first real experience working inside of a game loop using an old in-house graphical library known as
						CORE. Through this, we were taught the basics of Linear Algebra, collision detection, and update/draw calls.

					<p>
						I enjoy looking back on this not due to the complexity of the code that I wrote, but due to the difficulty of learning how to
						code all of it. When I took the class (C++ II) at Neumont, our Professor had a very laissez faire teaching approach. He would
						give us a word doc of what he wanted for the assignment and would then only answer specific questions. We had to self teach
						ourselves how to actually achieve collision detection, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've debated going back and cleaning up the code in this codebase several times or working on a side project with CORE, but
						I've always decide against it. Its on the todo list, just not very high in priority.
