                        This was the <span class="text-secondary">Object Oriented Programming and Design </span> class's final. This was supposed to
                        be a <span style="font-style: italic">simple</span> project to end the quarter with only a couple of weeks to work on it, but
                        also something difficult enough for us to display it in project showcase at the school. <br />
                        My group decided to try to create a multiplayer game in Java, a twist on the hunger games. Underestimating how difficult it
                        would be to accomplish that, especially since most of us had only been coding a couple months at this point. We had grand
                        visions of procedural generation and multiplayer and every thing working as intended. By the end of the project, we
                        <span style="font-style: italic">technically</span> had everything but the game portion.

                        I was in charge of the multiplayer or networking of the game. We had a very vague idea of what we needed to do to get it
                        playable by multiple people so I offered to take the helm on what turned out to be the hardest part. I wound up having to use
                        sockets in Java and manually creating/sending/receiving packets over the network. I had many sleepless nights trying to wrap
                        my head around this while still learning OOP principles, but was eventually able to get basic multiplayer working.

                        This is a project that we overscoped and underestimated, but was still able to create something that resembled our goal. If we
                        had a couple more weeks to work on it or had undertaken this at a later time, I feel like we could've reached our original
                        goal.
