                        <span style="font-style: italic"> large </span> group project that I ever worked on.<br />
                        Now that I have completed many other projects, this one doesn't seem anywhere near as complicated or difficult, but it is
                        still something that I look back at and take admiration in. This was my first stepping stone to prove that I am capable of
                        programming.

                        For the final we had to fully create a board game and our options were either Monopoly or Clue. We decided to take the
                        assignment above and beyond the basic requirements of being able to play the game in the console and created a fully
                        functioning ascii board with moving peices. (Seen Below)
