                        Hello, my name is Zachery Anderson and I am currently working on becoming a software engineer. I am attending
                        <a class="School" href="https://www.neumont.edu/" target="_blank"> Neumont College of Computer Science</a>
                        and I am midway through my senior year there. I have about a quarter and a half left before graduation in the fall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've always just "gone with flow" and so far its gotten me a lot of fun experiences and has let me meet a lot of interesting
                        people. I know that this is just the next step of this journey we call life and I can't wait to see where I end up afterwards.
                    </p>

                        <h3>Scouting</h3>
                        <p>
                            I am an Eagle Scout and I have spent about eleven years in the Boy Scouts of America's Scouting program and can say
                            without a doubt it has taught me many important life lessons and has given me experiences that I otherwise wouldn't of
                            had.

                        <h3>Gaming/Hobbies</h3>
                        <p>
                            Gaming is a hobby that keeps me thinking. I love the adventure aspect, leveling up, the stories that emerge, the world I
                            help create, and the characters I grow to know. Otherwise I enjoy doing work with my hands, things like woodworking.
